### response

Once the user selects their answer, the response is shown in two ways. A visual and audible reply tells the user if they are correct or not. Both the sound and colour are clear and obvious universal cues with accessibility in mind.
- The correct answer shows a green background on the button and triggers a ding (correct) sound.
- The incorrect answer shows a red background on the button and triggers a buzzer (incorrect) sound.
